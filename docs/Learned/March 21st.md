So today I have learned that we can create a sidebar category by creating a new folder under "docs". 
- Then you must add the category json file to that folder so that it becomes clickable and you can see the files within it.
- You can create a .md file within the folder for each day we learn something new.
- I want to learn how to use the sidebar.js file to organize things, but it looks complicated right now.
- I am sad about that.


sidebar_position: 1
sidebar_label: Guide
sidebar_class_name: blue

- The 3 can be used to order the various files on the website via the position and renamed accordingly via the label. Although right now I am unsure about class name and what it does?
- They need to be above the header of the page. And they must be opened and closed by three consecutive - dashes
- Furthermore you can organize a folder's position via the category.json file

- need to use yarn start in order to get the localhost website to be viewable. 
- yarn deploy is to get it onto the internet
- commiting is for the github repo to be updated
